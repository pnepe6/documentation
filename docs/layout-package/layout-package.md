Layout package are useful when you want to maintain a documentation (layout/configuration) across multiple projects.

It's easy because all you need to is upgrade the version in `package.json` to get the latest update.

It can contains customs:

- `Layout`: the documentation layout
- `Wrapper`: the wrapper for examples
- `styleguide.config.js`: styleGuide configuration (will be merged into ours)
- `loaders`: Loaders injected by the package
- `theme`: The `theme` and `makeTheme` respecting the Bootstrap Styled chart.
