This project can render markdown documentation using comments in source code with the help of two core dependencies:

- [react-styleguidist](http://react-styleguidist.js.org) for generating the HTML documentation and React component documentation.
- [documentationjs](http://documentation.js.org/) for generating JS documentation.

If you haven't read both documentations, we recommend you to read them first.
